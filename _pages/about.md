Hello, welcome to Jianmin personal website. I was born and raised in Minle county of Zhangye city(张掖市民乐县) in Gansu(甘肃) Province, China.

Currently,I'm a Ph.D. candidate（2021.03.01 to present） in department of Integrative Biotechnology at Yonsei University in Republic of Korea, advised by Prof. Kyoung Tai No and Prof. YoungSoo Kim.

My research involves drug discovery, medicinal chemistry,(generative) artificial intelligence, deep learning, chemoinformatics, and bioinformatics. I focus on applying deep learning methods and computational techniques to unlock drug R&D and health computing.
